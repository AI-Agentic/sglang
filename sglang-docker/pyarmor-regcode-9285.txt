lNkYVLq0N6jida5mVlJR49PHzClgzQ-VAK-Woy0B4OWiGpIzngTB0YpzbWuq-3rAQz2eumLFJhE_ExTf20iThrnhDR8qvf7wYZfVd_tPIYRzVevdcY-sHQR8TLAdIp34SEcGmEbKKgjXgZlTlX04QdmMey6EtZvQPUIlRjbpXmlI7Bkjye5QFoJseLJyNPFF

Internet connection and Pyarmor 9.0+ are required to activate this code, install Pyarmor and check Pyarmor version by this command

    pip install -U pyarmor
    pyarmor -v

Here are initial registration steps:

1. Download the attachment of this email, save it as "pyarmor-regcode-9285.txt"

2. Run the following command to activate this license, please replace "XXX" with product name or "non-profits" (only for obfuscating non-commercial projects)

     pyarmor reg -p XXX pyarmor-regcode-9285.txt

3. The registration file "pyarmor-regfile-9285.zip" will be created in the current path if this license is activated sucessfully

IMPORTANT NOTES:

* Please backup "pyarmor-regcode-9285.txt", but do not use it to register Pyarmor
* Please backup regfile "pyarmor-regfile-9285.zip", and use this file for next any registration
* Do not use this file in docker container and CI/CD pipeline
* Pyarmor Team doesn't provide LOST FOUND SERVICE

This registration file can be used to register Pyarmor in at most 100 devices

    pyarmor reg pyarmor-regfile-9285.zip

Check the new registration information

    pyarmor -v

On each device it's enough to register Pyarmor once, do not register Pyarmor before each obfuscation
